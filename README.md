# Running Competitive Programming Code in Different Languages

This repository contains code for solving competitive programming problems in three languages: Python, Go, and JavaScript. Each subfolder contains a problem and its solution in the respective language.

## Running the Code

To run the code for a specific problem, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the subfolder** for the problem you want to solve.
2. **Open a terminal** in the subfolder.
3. **Run the following command**, depending on the language you want to use:

   - **Python:** `python <problem_name>.py`
   - **Go:** `go run <problem_name>.go`
   - **JavaScript:** `node <problem_name>.js`

   Replace `<problem_name>` with the actual name of the problem file (e.g., `palindrome.py`, `balanced_parentheses.go`, `count_substrings.js`).

## Additional Notes

* Make sure you have the necessary language interpreters installed (Python, Go, and Node.js) before running the code.
* You can also use IDEs or code editors that support these languages to run and debug the code.
* The code in each subfolder may have specific dependencies or requirements. Check the comments within the code for more information.
